## About the Project
* The target audience for our online groceries shopping application would primarily consist of busy individuals or families who value convenience and time-saving solutions.
* The main problem being solved by our application is the hassle and time-consuming nature of traditional grocery shopping. By providing a user-friendly platform for purchasing groceries online, we aim to streamline the shopping experience, saving users time and effort. Additionally, our app offers the convenience of accessing a wide range of products from the comfort of one's home or on the go, eliminating the need to physically visit multiple stores.
